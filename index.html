    <h2>Introduction to the Data</h2>
    <p>This analysis utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing multiple variables across different geographic regions. The dataset includes various socioeconomic and demographic indicators that allow for multidimensional analysis of the relationships between different factors.</p>
    
    <p>The primary dataset contains information from multiple locations with several key features. The detailed information about each variable is presented in the table below:</p>

    <h3>Race and Income Distribution Overview</h3>
    
    <div class="centered-content">
      <div id="chart-container"></div>
    </div>
    
    <p>This bar chart visualizes the percentage of each racial group in the dataset making over $50,000 per year. As can be seen, the racial group that has the most individuals making over $50,000 per year, on average, is the Asian-Pacific-Islander group, with over 28 percent earning so. Closely following this group are White Americans, with over 26 percent earning above the threshold. In contrast, Black and American-Indian-Eskimo populations have significantly lower percentages at 11.6% and 9.9%, respectively. This difference helps to display a clear disparity between earnings for different racial groups in the United States in 1999.</p>

    <h3>Analysis of Connection Between Hours Worked and Income</h3>
    
    <div class="flex-container">
      <div class="flex-viz">
          <img src="percentEarningLineChart.svg" alt="Line graph showing percent earning over 50K by hours worked per week" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;">
      </div>
      <div class="flex-text">
        <p>This line chart shows a clear positive relationship between the percentage of individuals earning more than $50,000 and the number of hours worked per week for that given group. For lower hours, especially below 30 hours per week, the proportion of high earners tends to be low, generally below 10 percent. In contrast, as the weekly hours worked increase to above 35, the percentage of individuals earning above $50,000 rises significantly, displaying that working longer hours is strongly associated with higher income levels. While this trend does tend to fluctuate between 40 and 60 hours worked per week, it does continue upward overall. This graph suggests that higher-income individuals are more likely to work longer hours, displaying a potential connection between time commitment to work and earning potential.</p>

    <h3>Determining how Age and Sex affects Income</h3>
    <div class="flex-container reverse">
      <div class="flex-viz">
        <iframe src="IncomeByAgeAndSex.html" style="width:100%; height:500px; border:none; margin-top: 75px;"></iframe>
      </div>
      <div class="flex-text", style="margin-top: -100px;">
        <p>The scatter plot demonstrates how both an individual’s sex and age impacts their yearly earnings. There is a clear trend between age and income, with income increasing between the ages of 20 and 50 and decreasing past that. As age increases to values like 70, the trend is less consistent as there are less samples and older individuals tend to have retired by this age. There is also a clear and large gap of income between the sexes, although both groups do follow similar trends. Only one female age group had more than 10% of its group earn over 50k a year, whereas most male groups had more than 10% earning over 50k. Although the way in which age affects income is incredibly useful and insightful, the differences between the sexes is much more striking and decisive as a reason why one would earn more or less than 50,000 dollars a year. </p>

    <h2>Visualization #4</h2>
    <h3>How Occupation affects Income</h3>
    
    <p>Examining the relationship between occupation and income, we find that there is a correlation, based on the thickness of each connection from job to income. Using this diagram's interaction, found while hovering over the target endpoint, we can see that there are almost exactly three times as many individuals making under 50k a year than over. Looking at each occupation by itself, almost two-fifths of all people making over 50k have white collar jobs. At the same time, only a fourth of all individuals have white collar jobs, meaning this occupation earns more than most. Falling in second is professional work taking up more than a fifth of the high income earners. The other occupations are more evenly distributed in the result, except for the military. Although there are only three people in this group, none of them make over 50k a year. As one may expect, labor heavy jobs typically earn much less than non-labor and perhaps higher requirement professions. </p>

        <p>This comparative visualization facilitates direct comparisons between different observations or groups within the dataset. By presenting variables side by side, it becomes easier to identify similarities and differences across multiple dimensions. The comparison highlights which factors vary most significantly between groups and which remain relatively stable. This type of analysis is particularly valuable for understanding how different contexts or conditions affect the variables of interest and for identifying best practices or areas requiring attention.</p>

    <p>This final visualization examines patterns across time or sequential ordering within the dataset. Temporal analysis reveals trends, cycles, and changes that occur over the observation period. Understanding these dynamic patterns is essential for making predictions and identifying factors that drive change over time. The visualization shows both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends, providing a comprehensive view of how the variables evolve and interact throughout the study period.</p>

    <h2>Summary and Future Directions</h2>
    <p>This comprehensive analysis has explored multiple dimensions of the dataset through various visualization techniques and analytical approaches. The findings reveal important patterns and relationships that contribute to our understanding of the subject matter.</p>
    
    <p>Key limitations of this study include the temporal scope of the data and potential seasonal variations that may not be fully captured. Future work could expand the analysis to include additional time periods, incorporate more variables, or apply advanced statistical modeling techniques to better understand causal relationships.</p>
    
    <p>The insights gained from this analysis provide a foundation for informed decision-making and suggest several directions for continued research and investigation in this domain.</p>
