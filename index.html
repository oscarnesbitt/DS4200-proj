    <h2>Visualization #1</h2>
    <h3>Race and Income Distribution Overview</h3>
    
    <div class="centered-content">
      <div id="chart-container"></div>
    </div>
    
    <p>This bar chart visualizes the percentage of each racial group in the dataset making over $50,000 per year. As can be seen, the racial group that has the most individuals making over $50,000 per year, on average, is the Asian-Pacific-Islander group, with over 28 percent earning so. Closely following this group are White Americans, with over 26 percent earning above the threshold. In contrast, Black and American-Indian-Eskimo populations have significantly lower percentages at 11.6% and 9.9%, respectively. This difference helps to display a clear disparity between earnings for different racial groups in the United States in 1999.</p>

    <h3>Analysis of Connection Between Hours Worked and Income</h3>
    
    <div class="flex-container">
      <div class="flex-viz">
          <img src="percentEarningLineChart.svg" alt="Line graph showing percent earning over 50K by hours worked per week" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;">
      </div>
      <div class="flex-text">
        <p>This line chart shows a clear positive relationship between the percentage of individuals earning more than $50,000 and the number of hours worked per week for that given group. For lower hours, especially below 30 hours per week, the proportion of high earners tends to be low, generally below 10 percent. In contrast, as the weekly hours worked increase to above 35, the percentage of individuals earning above $50,000 rises significantly, displaying that working longer hours is strongly associated with higher income levels. While this trend does tend to fluctuate between 40 and 60 hours worked per week, it does continue upward overall. This graph suggests that higher-income individuals are more likely to work longer hours, displaying a potential connection between time commitment to work and earning potential.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="flex-text">
        <p>This analysis explores the relationships between multiple variables in the dataset, revealing which factors show strong associations with one another. Correlation patterns help identify potential causal relationships and interdependencies between different aspects of the phenomenon under study. Some variables demonstrate strong positive or negative correlations, while others show little to no linear relationship. These patterns guide our understanding of how different factors interact and influence each other within the system being analyzed.</p>

    <h2>Visualization #4</h2>
    <h3>Interactive Exploration Tool</h3>
    
    <p>The following interactive visualization allows users to explore relationships between variables in a dynamic way. By selecting different parameters and filtering the data, users can investigate specific subsets of the dataset and observe how patterns change under different conditions.</p>
    
    <div class="centered-content">
      <div class="viz-placeholder">

    <p>This tool enables deeper exploration of the data by allowing customized views based on user-selected criteria. The interactive nature of this visualization makes it possible to test hypotheses and discover patterns that might not be immediately apparent in static representations. Users can isolate specific ranges of values, compare different groups, and examine how multiple variables interact simultaneously to produce observed outcomes.</p>

    <h2>Visualization #5</h2>
    <h3>Comparative Analysis</h3>
    
    <div class="flex-container">

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="flex-text">
        <p>This comparative visualization facilitates direct comparisons between different observations or groups within the dataset. By presenting variables side by side, it becomes easier to identify similarities and differences across multiple dimensions. The comparison highlights which factors vary most significantly between groups and which remain relatively stable. This type of analysis is particularly valuable for understanding how different contexts or conditions affect the variables of interest and for identifying best practices or areas requiring attention.</p>

    <p>This final visualization examines patterns across time or sequential ordering within the dataset. Temporal analysis reveals trends, cycles, and changes that occur over the observation period. Understanding these dynamic patterns is essential for making predictions and identifying factors that drive change over time. The visualization shows both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends, providing a comprehensive view of how the variables evolve and interact throughout the study period.</p>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Summary and Future Directions</h2>
    <p>This comprehensive analysis has explored multiple dimensions of the dataset through various visualization techniques and analytical approaches. The findings reveal important patterns and relationships that contribute to our understanding of the subject matter.</p>
    
    <p>Key limitations of this study include the temporal scope of the data and potential seasonal variations that may not be fully captured. Future work could expand the analysis to include additional time periods, incorporate more variables, or apply advanced statistical modeling techniques to better understand causal relationships.</p>
    
    <p>The insights gained from this analysis provide a foundation for informed decision-making and suggest several directions for continued research and investigation in this domain.</p>
